# Advent of Code 2021

Although I heard about the first AoC, I haven't participated until now.
My primary goal this year is to explore modern C++, as I normally think
of myself as a C programmer but must teach C++ to my students. I'm
using these puzzles as practice thinking idiomatically in C++ as its
own language.
